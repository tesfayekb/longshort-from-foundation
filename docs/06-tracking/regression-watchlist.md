# Regression Watchlist

> **Owner:** Project Lead | **Last Reviewed:** 2026-04-11

## Purpose

Operational guardrail that tracks known regression risks, fragile areas, and past failures. Used as a mandatory pre-change verification checklist for every MEDIUM/HIGH impact change.

## Scope

All areas with known fragility, past regressions, or identified risk from the regression strategy and risk register.

## Enforcement Rule (CRITICAL)

- No MEDIUM/HIGH change may be completed without reviewing **all relevant** watchlist items
- Any relevant watchlist item not verified = change **cannot proceed**
- Watchlist verification must include evidence (test pass, runtime data, or documented manual check)
- Ignoring known watchlist risks is an **INVALID** change
- Critical-priority items must be checked **every time** their affected module changes

### RW-006: Health Monitoring Blind Spot

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | Health / Monitoring |

| **Regression Class** | Observability |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Affected Modules** | health-monitoring, admin-panel |

### RW-007: User Lifecycle Deactivation/Reactivation Regression

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | User Management / Auth |
| **Risk Description** | Deactivation or reactivation fails to synchronize auth-layer ban state with profile status, resulting in users locked out after reactivation or still able to login after deactivation |
| **Regression Class** | Security / Authorization |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Affected Modules** | user-management, auth |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any change to: deactivate-user, reactivate-user, auth admin API calls, profile status update logic, `check_user_active_on_login` trigger, compensating rollback logic |
| **Detection** | Full lifecycle E2E test (create → deactivate → verify blocked → reactivate → verify login restored), rollback path tests |

| **Status** | Active |

### RW-008: PERMISSION_DEPS Map Drift Across 3 Copies

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | RBAC / Configuration |
| **Risk Description** | The PERMISSION_DEPS map exists in 3 locations: `src/config/permission-deps.ts`, `assign-permission-to-role/index.ts`, and `revoke-permission-from-role/index.ts`. Adding or removing a dependency in one copy without updating the others causes silent enforcement inconsistency — client may allow what server blocks, or server may not enforce what client shows. |
| **Regression Class** | Authorization / Data Integrity |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Affected Modules** | rbac, admin-panel |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any change to permission dependencies, adding new permissions, modifying PERMISSION_DEPS in any of the 3 files |
| **Detection** | Manual diff of all 3 copies, automated hash comparison (future) |
| **Required Checks** | 1) All 3 PERMISSION_DEPS maps have identical entries. 2) Any new permission with dependencies is added to all 3 files. 3) permission-index.md `depends_on` field matches. |
| **Verification Type** | Manual (automated drift detection deferred — DW-027) |

| **Status** | Active |

### RW-011: Empty CAPTCHA Payload Breaks Password Auth

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | Auth / CAPTCHA |
| **Risk Description** | Auth flows treat CAPTCHA as mandatory when Turnstile is disabled or unconfigured, or forward empty/placeholder CAPTCHA payloads to Supabase Auth, causing `captcha verification process failed` and blocking sign-in, sign-up, or reauth in preview/development |
| **Regression Class** | Functional / Security |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Affected Modules** | auth, user-panel, admin-panel |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any change to sign-in/sign-up/reauth auth payload shaping, Turnstile integration, dev-mode bypass logic, or CAPTCHA configuration handling |
| **Detection** | Password sign-in runtime verification, reauth runtime verification, network payload inspection, auth error monitoring |
| **Required Checks** | 1) Password and OTP auth requests omit CAPTCHA fields when no real token exists. 2) UI does not render or block on Turnstile when no public site key is configured. 3) Real CAPTCHA tokens are still forwarded when present. 4) Auth succeeds with CAPTCHA disabled in Supabase. |
| **Verification Type** | Runtime + manual |

### RW-016: Configurable MFA Policy Enforcement Gate

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | Auth / MFA / RBAC |
| **Risk Description** | Regression in the per-panel or per-user MFA gate either (a) silently weakens enforcement (admins can reach `/admin` without an MFA factor when policy is `required`), (b) over-enforces (forces enrollment when policy is `optional` or user has not opted in), (c) accepts an out-of-enum value such as `disabled`, or (d) lets a non-superadmin mutate the panel policy. Any of these breaks the contract established by PLAN-AUTH-MFA-POLICY-001 / DEC-028. |
| **Regression Class** | Security / Authorization |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Affected Modules** | auth, admin-panel, user-panel, rbac |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any change to: `AdminLayout`, `UserLayout`, `useMfaPolicy`, `get-mfa-policy`, `update-mfa-policy`, `update-mfa-self-pref`, `system_config.mfa_enforcement_policy` seed, `profiles.require_mfa_for_self`, `RequireAuth` MFA branch |
| **Detection** | `src/test/rw016-mfa-policy-enforcement.test.ts` (static contract checks) + Deno tests on the three edge functions + manual toggle smoke test |
| **Required Checks** | 1) AdminLayout redirects to `/mfa-enroll` IFF `panels.admin === 'required'` AND `mfaStatus === 'none'`. 2) UserLayout redirects IFF `require_mfa_for_self === true` AND `mfaStatus === 'none'`. 3) `update-mfa-policy` requires superadmin + `admin.config` + recent reauth and rejects values outside `'required' \| 'optional'`. 4) `update-mfa-self-pref` only mutates the caller's own profile row. 5) Every successful policy/preference write emits its audit event. 6) Policy is prefetched in both layouts to keep paint latency unchanged. |

## Pre-Change Verification Workflow

Before completing any MEDIUM/HIGH impact change:

1. **Identify** affected modules from the change
2. **Pull** all watchlist items matching affected modules or trigger conditions (automated matching where available)
3. **Execute** required checks for each matching item
4. **Record** verification evidence in standardized format (see Evidence Standardization)
5. **If any check fails** → change cannot proceed until resolved
6. **If new fragility discovered** → add new watchlist item before completing change

### System-Level Watchlist Gate

Before any HIGH-impact change completes, the system must confirm:

- All matching watchlist items verified with evidence
- No critical items skipped
- Evidence recorded in standardized format
- No new untracked fragility introduced
- Override protocol followed if any item unresolvable (see Override Protocol)

**Gate failure = change cannot proceed.**

---

## Leading vs Lagging Indicators

Each watchlist item should define early warning and post-occurrence signals:

| Item | Leading Indicators (Early Warning) | Lagging Indicators (After Occurrence) |
|------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| RW-001 | Cache invalidation delay > threshold, invalidation error rate rising | Actual permission mismatch observed in UI/API |
| RW-002 | RLS policy change without benchmark, query plan drift on tenant tables | Unauthorized row access, cross-tenant data exposure |
| RW-003 | Function signature change detected, no cross-module test update | Downstream module failures, unexpected behavior |
| RW-004 | Retry config change without test, DLQ depth trend increasing | Duplicate execution, retry storm, job cascade |
| RW-005 | Audit emission logic changed, error handling path modified | Missing audit entries in reconciliation |
| RW-006 | Health check logic changed, alert threshold modified, monitoring config updated | False positive/negative alerts, monitoring blind spot, dashboard shows incorrect state |

**Rule:** Leading indicators should be monitored proactively — catching them prevents the regression from materializing.

---

## SSOT Artifact Traceability

Each watchlist item should map to specific SSOT artifacts for instant test targeting:

| Item | Related Routes | Related Permissions | Related Functions | Related Events |
|------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| RW-001 | All permission-gated routes | All RBAC permissions | `has_role()`, `checkPermission()` | `rbac.role_assigned`, `rbac.role_revoked` |
| RW-002 | All tenant-scoped data routes | `users.*`, `audit.*` | RLS policy functions | — |
| RW-003 | Routes consuming shared functions | Per function | All shared functions (function-index) | — |
| RW-004 | Admin job management routes | `jobs.*` | Job execution functions | `job.failed`, `job.dead_lettered` |
| RW-005 | All mutation routes | `audit.view`, `audit.export` | `logAuditEvent()` | `audit.logged`, `audit.write_failed` |
| RW-006 | `/admin/monitoring`, `/admin/monitoring/config`, `GET /health` | `monitoring.view`, `monitoring.configure` | `getSystemHealth()`, `evaluateAlerts()`, `getMetrics()` | `health.alert_triggered`, `health.status_changed`, `health.monitoring_failed` |
| RW-007 | `/admin/users/:id/deactivate`, `/admin/users/:id/reactivate` | `users.deactivate`, `users.reactivate` | `deactivateUser()`, `reactivateUser()` | `user.account_deactivated`, `user.account_reactivated` |
| RW-008 | `/admin/roles/:id` (permission assign/revoke) | `permissions.assign`, `permissions.revoke` | `PERMISSION_DEPS` config | `rbac.permission_assigned`, `rbac.permission_revoked` |
| RW-009 | All Phase 4 routes | All UI-gated permissions | All shared components | — |
| RW-010 | `/mfa-enroll`, `/admin` | `admin.access` | `checkMfaStatus()` | `auth.mfa_enrolled` |

**Rule:** When reviewing a change, match changed SSOT artifacts against watchlist traceability to identify all relevant items.

---

## Verification Evidence Standardization

All verification evidence must follow a standardized format:

| Evidence Type | Required Content |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Automated test** | Test run ID + pass/fail + timestamp + CI link |
| **Runtime verification** | Monitoring dashboard link + metric values + time range |
| **Manual check** | Screenshot/recording + timestamp + verifier name |
| **Log/trace reference** | Trace ID + relevant log entries + timestamp |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of above as appropriate |

**Rules:**
- "Checked" without evidence is **not valid** verification
- Evidence must be linked or embedded in the change record
- Evidence must be timestamped within the current change cycle

---

## Automatic Population Rules

Watchlist must be updated when:

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Regression detected (from regression strategy) | Add watchlist item |
| Risk materializes (from risk register) | Add watchlist item for affected area |
| Test failure reveals fragility | Add watchlist item |
| Post-release issue found | Add watchlist item |
| Manual verification finds edge case | Add watchlist item |
| Adversarial test reveals vulnerability | Add watchlist item |

**Rule:** Population is both manual and event-driven — any discovery of fragility must result in a watchlist entry.

### Automated Watchlist Matching (Design Rule)

The system should support automatic mapping of changed modules to relevant watchlist items:

- On each change, identify affected modules and files
- Match against watchlist `affected_modules` and `trigger_conditions`
- Surface matching items to the developer before completion
- Even if implemented later, all watchlist items must be structured to support automated matching

---

## Recurrence Tracking and Escalation

| Recurrence Count | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | Normal — item remains active |
| 2 | Warning — enhanced test coverage required |
| 3+ | **Escalate to Risk Register** if not already linked |
| 5+ | Mandatory architectural review — point fixes insufficient |

### Regression Test Auto-Generation Rule

- Watchlist items with recurrence ≥ 2 **must** be converted into automated regression tests
- Goal: reduce manual verification over time
- Once automated test exists and passes consistently, manual verification requirement may be relaxed (item remains active but verification = test pass)

**Rules:**
- Recurrence count incremented each time the regression actually occurs (not each time checked)
- Recurrent items must be flagged in Top Fragile Areas summary
- Escalation creates Action Tracker entry

---

## Lifecycle Management

| Status | Definition | Rules |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Active** | Known risk, must be checked on relevant changes | Mandatory verification |
| **Resolved** | Root cause fixed, regression test in place | Must include resolution date + evidence |
| **Archived** | Stale (> 90 days resolved) or no longer relevant | Reviewed before archival |

### Cleanup Rules

- Resolved items remain for history — never deleted
- Items active > 90 days without verification → must be reviewed (confirm relevance or archive)
- Archival requires confirmation that:
  - Root cause addressed
  - Regression test exists (or justified exception)
  - No recent recurrence

### Watchlist Drift Detection

- Periodic review (monthly) must check:
  - Missing new risk patterns not yet on watchlist
  - Outdated items no longer relevant
  - Items never triggered or verified (stale detection)
- Drift detected → update watchlist + Action Tracker entry if gap is critical

---

## Watchlist Coverage Completeness

**Rule:** Every critical module must have at least one active watchlist item.

| Module | Required Coverage | Current Items |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Auth / Session | ≥ 1 item | RW-001 (via RBAC) |
| RBAC / Permissions | ≥ 1 item | RW-001 |
| RLS / Database | ≥ 1 item | RW-002 |
| Jobs / Scheduler | ≥ 1 item | RW-004 |
| Audit Logging | ≥ 1 item | RW-005 |
| Caching | ≥ 1 item | RW-001 (via cache) |
| Shared Functions | ≥ 1 item | RW-003 |
| Admin Panel | Covered via module items | RW-001, RW-005 |
| Health Monitoring | ≥ 1 item | RW-006 |

**Gap Detection:** Absence of watchlist item for a fragile module = coverage gap → must be addressed.

---

## Watchlist Performance Constraint

The watchlist must remain **high-signal, not bloated**:

- Target: ≤ 20 active items at any time
- Low-value items should be:
  - Merged with related items
  - Archived if risk is fully mitigated by automated tests
  - Escalated to permanent regression tests (removing manual verification need)
- Quarterly review must prune or consolidate

**Rule:** Watchlist overhead must not materially slow development velocity — if it does, items must be converted to automated tests.

---

## High-Risk Change Override Protocol

When a change must proceed despite unresolved watchlist items:

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Explicit approval** | Project lead or designated authority |
| **Documented justification** | Why override is necessary |
| **Mitigation plan** | How risk will be managed post-merge |
| **Follow-up Action Tracker item** | With owner, severity, and resolution timeline |
| **Time-bounded** | Override expires — follow-up must resolve within SLA |

**Rules:**
- Override is exceptional — not routine
- Override count tracked — frequent overrides = systemic problem
- Critical-priority items cannot be overridden without CRITICAL-level approval

---

## Testing Integration

- Every watchlist item **must** link to at least one regression test (if automatable)
- If no automated test exists, justification must be documented:

| Justification | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Visual/layout only | Complex UI interaction not reliably automated |
| Environment-dependent | Requires production-like infra for meaningful test |
| Pending implementation | Test planned, not yet built (must have timeline) |

**Rule:** "Pending implementation" justification expires after 30 days — test must be built or item escalated.

---

## Action Tracker Integration

The following **MUST** create Action Tracker entries:

| Trigger | Severity | Target Resolution |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Watchlist check failure during change | HIGH | 24h (blocks change) |
| Repeated failure of same item (3+) | HIGH | Architectural review |
| Unresolved active item > 90 days | MEDIUM | Review/resolve within 1 week |
| Critical item triggered | CRITICAL | 4h |
| New critical item added | HIGH | Verification within 24h |
| Override invoked | MEDIUM | Follow-up per SLA |
| Coverage gap detected | MEDIUM | 1 week |
| Watchlist drift detected | MEDIUM | 1 week |

### RW-009: UI Design System Compliance

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | UI (Phase 4) |
| **Risk Description** | Phase 4 pages may introduce off-system colors, page-local component variants, ungoverned dialog/table/form patterns, or route/permission keys not in SSOT indexes |
| **Regression Class** | UX |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Affected Modules** | admin-panel, user-panel |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any Phase 4 page creation or modification |
| **Detection Method** | Code review: grep for raw Tailwind palette colors, check imports against component inventory, verify routes against route-index |
| **Required Checks** | (1) No raw colors (`bg-red-*`, `text-blue-*`, `bg-[#...]`) in component code. (2) All tables use `DataTable`. (3) All destructive flows use `ConfirmActionDialog`. (4) All async states use governed LoadingSkeleton/ErrorState/EmptyState. (5) All routes exist in route-index. (6) All permission keys exist in permission-index. |

### RW-010: MFA Enroll Route State Drift

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | Auth / MFA |
| **Risk Description** | `/mfa-enroll` may ignore existing verified or incomplete TOTP factors, causing duplicate-enrollment errors or trapping admins on the enrollment route instead of returning them to the requested admin page |
| **Regression Class** | UX / Workflow |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Affected Modules** | auth, admin-panel, user-panel |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any change to AuthContext MFA status resolution, AdminLayout MFA guard, MfaEnroll.tsx, MfaChallenge.tsx, factor naming, or factor cleanup behavior |
| **Detection Method** | Manual route verification, preview network traces, auth journey testing |
| **Required Checks** | 1) Admin without MFA visiting `/admin` is redirected to `/mfa-enroll`. 2) Successful enroll auto-returns with a visible fallback button. 3) Already-enrolled admin does not see a blind re-enroll CTA in forced-enrollment context. 4) Adding another factor from Security Settings does not reuse a conflicting friendly name. 5) Incomplete unverified factors can be cleared and restarted. |
| **Verification Type** | Manual + code review |

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | Auth / Sudo Mode |
| **Risk Description** | Regression in `RequireSudo`, `useSudoGate`, `useSudoMode`, or `ReauthDialog` could let MFA enroll, `require_mfa_for_self` toggles, recovery-code generation, or MFA unenroll proceed without a fresh credential proof, re-opening the unlocked-public-computer attack vector closed by PLAN-AUTH-SUDO-001 / DEC-029. |
| **Regression Class** | Security / Authorization |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Affected Modules** | auth, user-panel, audit-logging |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any change to `useSudoMode`, `useSudoGate`, `RequireSudo`, `ReauthDialog`, `SelfMfaPrefCard`, `PasswordChangeCard`, `SecurityPage`, `MfaEnroll`, or sudo session-storage key. |
| **Detection Method** | Vitest regression suite + manual sensitive-flow walkthrough. |
| **Required Checks** | (1) MFA enroll route blocked until sudo. (2) `require_mfa_for_self` toggle (ON/OFF) blocked until sudo. (3) Recovery-code generation blocked until sudo. (4) MFA unenroll blocked until re-auth. (5) After sudo expiry, all four re-prompt. (6) `signOut()` and `updatePassword()` clear sudo. |
| **Verification Type** | Automated test (rw017) + manual |

### RW-018: Sudo Audit-Event Completeness

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | Auth / Audit Logging |
| **Risk Description** | Sudo grant or sensitive-action emit path could silently drop the `auth.sudo_granted` / `auth.sensitive_action_performed` audit row, lose `actor_id` from the JWT, or write the wrong `action_key`, breaking the end-to-end audit chain mandated by PLAN-AUTH-SUDO-001. |
| **Regression Class** | Audit |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Affected Modules** | auth, audit-logging |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any change to `log-sudo-event`, `logSudoEvent`, `RequireSudo`, `useSudoGate`, or audit-event registration in event-index. |
| **Detection Method** | Vitest regression suite asserting one row per grant + per sensitive action, with correct `actor_id` and `action_key`. |
| **Required Checks** | (1) Every sudo grant emits `auth.sudo_granted` with `actor_id` from JWT and matching `action_key`. (2) Every protected sensitive action emits `auth.sensitive_action_performed` with same `actor_id` and `action_key`. (3) Both events declared in event-index. |
| **Verification Type** | Automated test (rw018) |

### RW-019: Sudo correlation_id Propagation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | Auth / Audit Logging / API |
| **Risk Description** | Client-generated `correlation_id` could fail to propagate through `apiClient` → `log-sudo-event` request → audit_logs row → 200/500 response, breaking cross-system trace lookups. |
| **Regression Class** | Audit / Functional |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Affected Modules** | auth, audit-logging, api |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any change to `src/lib/api-client.ts`, `src/lib/sudo-audit.ts`, `supabase/functions/log-sudo-event/index.ts`, or correlation-id generation. |
| **Detection Method** | Client-side Vitest suite + Deno server-side tests asserting cid round-trip on success and 500 paths. |
| **Required Checks** | (1) Client buffer cid matches request body cid. (2) Server persists client cid into audit_logs row on success. (3) Server returns the same cid in 200 and 500 responses. (4) Server-generated cid (when client omits) flows into both row and response. |
| **Verification Type** | Automated test (rw019 + log-sudo-event index_test) |
| **Related Tests** | `src/test/rw019-sudo-correlation-id.test.ts`, `supabase/functions/log-sudo-event/index_test.ts` |
| **Related Risk** | — |
| **Recurrence Count** | 0 |

### RW-020: audit_logs.correlation_id Index DDL Contract

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Area** | Database / Audit Logging |
| **Risk Description** | Loss, rename, type change, or removal of the partial-`WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL` predicate on `idx_audit_logs_correlation_id` would silently degrade trace lookups from index seek to full table scan as audit_logs grows. |
| **Regression Class** | Performance / Data Integrity |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Affected Modules** | audit-logging, database |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Any migration touching `audit_logs` indexes; any change to `sql/01_rbac_schema.sql` or `sql/08_audit_correlation_id_index.sql`; any change to the audit-correlation-id-index contract doc. |
| **Detection Method** | Static DDL validation in Vitest (rw020) + inline `DO $$ ... $$` self-check inside the migration that fails on missing/wrong shape. |
| **Required Checks** | (1) Index name `idx_audit_logs_correlation_id` exists in both schema and migration files. (2) Index uses `btree (correlation_id)`. (3) Predicate is `WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL`. (4) Lookup tests filter by `correlation_id` only and exclude null-cid rows. (5) Contract doc unchanged or change accompanied by a new migration + ledger entry. |
| **Verification Type** | Automated test (rw020) + migration self-check |
| **Related Tests** | `src/test/rw020-audit-correlation-index.test.ts` |

## Link to Risk Register

- Watchlist = **tactical** (day-to-day change verification)
- Risk Register = **strategic** (system-level risk governance)
- Every watchlist item should reference a risk (if applicable)
- High-recurrence watchlist items must be escalated to risk register
- Risk materialization creates corresponding watchlist item for ongoing verification

## Dependencies

- [Regression Strategy](../05-quality/regression-strategy.md)
- [Change Control Policy](../00-governance/change-control-policy.md)
- [Risk Register](risk-register.md)
- [Testing Strategy](../05-quality/testing-strategy.md)

## Used By / Affects

All MEDIUM/HIGH impact changes — mandatory pre-change verification tool.

## Risks If Changed

MEDIUM — weakening watchlist verification directly increases regression risk across all modules.
