# Stage 5 Plan — Operations & Reliability

> **CLOSED-HISTORICAL (ACT-365).** Platform Phase 5 closed — closure record at `docs/08-planning/phase-closures/phase-05-closure.md` (PLATFORM Phase 5; distinct from §10 Phase 5 per ledger Drift D3). Preserved for historical reference (Constitution Rule 8); NOT a live plan.

> **Owner:** Project Lead | **Created:** 2026-04-12 | **Plan Version:** v10.1
> **Modules:** PLAN-HEALTH-001, PLAN-JOBS-001
> **Depends On:** Phase 4 complete (all modules), Phase 3.5 hardening complete

## Purpose

Implement health monitoring, job scheduling, and operational infrastructure. Includes DW-019 (User Session Revocation) as a Phase 4 carryover with no blocking dependency on health/jobs infrastructure.

## Decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D5-001 | Include DW-019 in Phase 5 | Self-contained; only needs revoke-sessions edge function using Supabase admin signOut API. No dependency on health/jobs. |
| D5-002 | Defer DW-020 to Phase 6 | No backend infrastructure or schema exists for notification preferences. |
| D5-003 | Defer DW-023 to Phase 6 | Display formatting improvement with no operational impact. |
| D5-004 | Include job_idempotency_keys table in Stage 5C | Infrastructure must exist before any job can declare `exactly_once` semantics, even if no Phase 5 jobs require it. |

## Stages

---

### Stage 5A — Health Check Infrastructure

**Scope:**
- `system_health_snapshots` table with RLS (only `monitoring.view` holders can SELECT)
- `GET /health` public edge function — returns `{ status, timestamp }` only (no internals)
- `GET /health/detailed` authenticated edge function — requires `monitoring.view` permission, returns per-subsystem check results
- Health status model: `healthy | degraded | unhealthy`
- Subsystem checks: database connectivity, auth service, audit pipeline
- Audit events: `health.status_changed`

**Schema — `system_health_snapshots`:**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | uuid | PK, gen_random_uuid() |
| status | text | healthy / degraded / unhealthy |
| checks | jsonb | Per-subsystem results |
| created_at | timestamptz | now() |

**RLS:** SELECT for authenticated users with `monitoring.view`. No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE via client — edge functions use service role.

**Edge Functions:**
- `health-check` — public, no auth required, returns minimal status
- `health-detailed` — requires Bearer JWT + `monitoring.view`

**Phase Gate 5A:**
- [ ] `GET /health` returns correct status without auth
- [ ] `GET /health/detailed` requires `monitoring.view` and returns subsystem details
- [ ] `system_health_snapshots` table created with correct RLS
- [ ] No sensitive internals in unauthenticated health response
- [ ] `health.status_changed` event emitted on status transition

---

### Stage 5B — Metrics & Alerting Infrastructure

**Scope:**
- `system_metrics` table — stores time-series metric snapshots
- `alert_configs` table — configurable alert thresholds
- `alert_history` table — triggered alert records
- Alert severity model: `info | warning | critical`
- Monitoring domains: API, auth, database, jobs, audit, integrations
- `GET /health/metrics` edge function — requires `monitoring.view`
- `GET /health/alerts` edge function — requires `monitoring.view`
- `POST /health/alert-config` edge function — requires `monitoring.configure`
- Audit events: `health.alert_triggered`, `health.monitoring_failed`

**Schema — `system_metrics`:**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | uuid | PK |
| metric_key | text | e.g., `api.error_rate_5xx`, `auth.failure_rate` |

- `idx_alert_history_config` ON `alert_history(alert_config_id)`
- `idx_alert_history_created` ON `alert_history(created_at)`

**Phase Gate 5B:**
- [ ] `system_metrics`, `alert_configs`, `alert_history` tables created with RLS
- [ ] All indexes created and verified
- [ ] Alert thresholds configurable via `POST /health/alert-config`
- [ ] Alert evaluation produces correct `alert_history` entries

### Stage 5C — Job Scheduler Infrastructure

**Scope:**
- `job_registry` table — SSOT for all registered jobs
- `job_executions` table — execution history with full lifecycle tracking
- `job_idempotency_keys` table — for `exactly_once` guarantee (unique constraint, 7-day retention)
- 11-state lifecycle model: registered → scheduled → queued → running → succeeded/retry_pending/failed/dead_lettered/paused/cancelled/poison
- Concurrency policies: forbid / replace / allow
- Error classification: transient, dependency, validation, authorization, permanent
- Retry backoff: 30s → 2m → 10m → dead-letter
- Shared `executeWithRetry()` utility function
- Dead-letter handling with operator action paths
- Poison job detection (threshold: 5 consecutive cross-execution failures)
- Job versioning — execution stores version used at runtime

**Schema — `job_registry`:**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | text | PK, job identifier (e.g., `health_check`) |
| version | text | Semantic version |

**RLS:** All tables SELECT-only for `jobs.view`. Mutations via edge functions with service role.

**Indexes:**
- `idx_job_executions_job_state` ON `job_executions(job_id, state)`
- `idx_job_executions_state` ON `job_executions(state)` — dead-letter queries
- `idx_job_executions_schedule_window` ON `job_executions(job_id, schedule_window_id)` — dedup checks

**Shared Functions:**
- `executeWithRetry(jobId, handler, options)` — retry wrapper with backoff, jitter, error classification
- `classifyError(error)` — returns transient/dependency/validation/authorization/permanent
- `detectPoisonJob(jobId)` — checks consecutive cross-execution failure count

**Phase Gate 5C:**
- [ ] `job_registry`, `job_executions`, `job_idempotency_keys` tables created with RLS
- [ ] All indexes created and verified
- [ ] `executeWithRetry()` correctly implements backoff with jitter
- [ ] Error classification routes errors to correct retry/fail-fast paths
- [ ] `schedule_window_id` dedup prevents duplicate execution
- [ ] Poison detection triggers at configured threshold (default: 5)
- [ ] Job versioning stored on every execution record
- [ ] Idempotency key unique constraint enforced

### Stage 5D — Core Jobs Implementation

**Scope:** Implement the 4 jobs defined in the module doc job registry:

| Job | Schedule | Class | Owner Module |
|-----|----------|-------|-------------|
| `health_check` | Every 1 min | system_critical | health-monitoring |
| `metrics_aggregate` | Every 5 min | operational | health-monitoring |
| `alert_evaluation` | Every 1 min | system_critical | health-monitoring |
| `audit_cleanup` | Weekly | maintenance | audit-logging |

**Implementation:**
- Each job is an edge function invoked via `pg_cron` + `pg_net`
- Each job uses `executeWithRetry()` wrapper
- Each job emits start/complete/fail audit events
- `health_check` checks: DB ping, auth service, audit write test
- `metrics_aggregate` aggregates from `system_health_snapshots` into `system_metrics`
- `alert_evaluation` reads `system_metrics` + `alert_configs`, writes to `alert_history`
- `audit_cleanup` archives records older than 90 days (per DEC-007)

**Formal Job Execution Contract (per module doc):**
- Every job declares: concurrency_policy, idempotency_strategy, execution_guarantee, failure_classification
- Every execution has matching start + terminal audit event
- All timestamps UTC
- Resource budgets enforced per job registry
- Every run populates all 6 telemetry columns: `scheduled_time`, `duration_ms`, `queue_delay_ms`, `failure_type`, `affected_records`, `resource_usage`

**Phase Gate 5D:**
- [ ] All 4 jobs registered in `job_registry`
- [ ] Each job executes on schedule via `pg_cron`
- [ ] Start and terminal audit events for every execution
- [ ] `health_check` correctly detects DB/auth/audit subsystem status
- [ ] `audit_cleanup` respects 90-day retention (DEC-007)
- [ ] `alert_evaluation` fires `health.alert_triggered` on threshold breach
- [ ] `job.slo_breach` fires when SLO threshold violated
- [ ] All jobs use `executeWithRetry()` with correct retry policies
- [ ] All 6 telemetry columns populated on every execution

---

### Stage 5E — Emergency Controls & Operational Governance

**Scope:**
- Global kill switch — stops all job execution immediately
- Per-job kill switch — pauses individual jobs
- Class-level pause — pause all jobs of a given class
- `POST /jobs/kill-switch` edge function — requires `jobs.emergency`
- `POST /jobs/pause` edge function — requires `jobs.pause`
- `POST /jobs/resume` edge function — requires `jobs.pause`
- `GET /jobs/dead-letters` edge function — requires `jobs.deadletter.manage`, returns `job_executions` WHERE `state = 'dead_lettered'`
- `POST /jobs/replay-dead-letter` edge function — requires `jobs.deadletter.manage` + `requireRecentAuth()`, re-executes with original or current version, audits `job.replayed`
- All emergency actions audited with actor, reason, timestamp
- Circuit breaker: repeated dependency failures auto-pause affected jobs

**Permissions (already seeded in Phase 2 — no migration required):**

| Permission | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `jobs.view` | View job registry and execution history |
| `jobs.trigger` | Manually trigger job execution |
| `jobs.pause` | Pause/resume individual jobs or job classes |
| `jobs.resume` | Resume paused jobs |
| `jobs.retry` | Retry failed job executions |
| `jobs.emergency` | Activate global kill switch |
| `jobs.deadletter.manage` | View and replay dead-lettered executions |

> **Note:** All permissions listed above were seeded in `sql/04_rbac_seed.sql` during Phase 2. No seeding work is required in Phase 5.

**Phase Gate 5E:**
- [ ] Kill switch immediately stops all new executions
- [ ] Per-job pause moves job to `paused` state
- [ ] Class-level pause affects all jobs of that class
- [ ] `system_critical` only pausable via global kill switch
- [ ] All emergency actions produce audit entries
- [ ] Circuit breaker auto-pauses on repeated dependency failures
- [ ] `GET /jobs/dead-letters` returns dead-lettered executions
- [ ] `POST /jobs/replay-dead-letter` creates new execution record and audits `job.replayed`

---

### Stage 5F — Admin UI & DW-019

**Scope:**
- Health monitoring dashboard in admin panel (requires `monitoring.view`)
- Job management dashboard in admin panel (requires `jobs.view`)
- Job detail view with execution history
- Dead-letter management: inspect, replay, cancel, mark resolved
- Emergency controls UI: kill switch, pause/resume
- Alert configuration UI (requires `monitoring.configure`)
- **DW-019: User Self-Service Session Revocation** — revoke-sessions edge function, user panel SecurityPage UI

**DW-019 Implementation:**
- Location: `SecurityPage.tsx` (user panel), NOT admin panel
- `POST /revoke-sessions` edge function — accepts `{ scope: 'others' | 'global' }`, uses `ctx.user.id` directly as the target (no user_id body param, no `requireSelfScope` needed — self-scope enforced by function architecture), calls `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.signOut(userId, scope)`, applies `requireRecentAuth()`, audits `user.sessions_revoked` with scope in metadata
- No session listing in Phase 5 — Supabase admin SDK returns no useful session metadata; listing is only meaningful with per-session revocation (Phase 6)
- UI: Two distinct actions on SecurityPage:
  - **"Sign out other devices"** — scope: `others`, standard action, keeps current session active
  - **"Sign out everywhere"** — scope: `global`, destructive action with confirmation dialog, invalidates all sessions including current. **Client must redirect to `/sign-in` after success** because the current session is now invalidated.
- Phase 6 DW item: Per-session revocation with session list view — revisit when Supabase stabilizes auth.sessions API or adds individual session revocation to admin SDK
- Audit event: `user.sessions_revoked` (with `{ scope }` in metadata)

**Phase Gate 5F:**
- [ ] Health dashboard reflects real system state
- [ ] Job dashboard shows registry, executions, dead-letter queue
- [ ] Dead-letter actions (replay, cancel, resolve) function correctly
- [ ] Kill switch and pause controls accessible and functional
- [ ] Alert configuration UI creates/updates alert_configs
- [ ] DW-019: "Sign out other devices" revokes other sessions, user stays logged in
- [ ] DW-019: "Sign out everywhere" terminates all sessions with confirmation dialog and redirects to `/sign-in`
- [ ] DW-019: Both actions require reauth and produce audit trail
- [ ] All new pages use DashboardLayout shell and design system tokens

---

### Stage 5G — Gate Verification & Phase Closure

## Execution Order

Stages MUST execute sequentially: 5A → 5B → 5C → 5D → 5E → 5F → 5G

- 5B depends on 5A (metrics reference health snapshots)
- 5C is independent but sequenced for review cadence
- 5D depends on 5C (jobs use job infrastructure)
- 5E depends on 5C (emergency controls target job registry)
- 5F depends on all prior stages (UI surfaces everything)
- 5G depends on all prior stages (gate verification)
- DW-019 in 5F has no dependency on 5A-5E but is sequenced to avoid context-switching
