# Approved Decisions

> **Owner:** Project Lead | **Last Reviewed:** 2026-04-09

## Purpose

Anti-forgetting ledger.
Every approved decision is recorded here with a stable ID.

This document is the authoritative memory for all approved architecture, security, and system rules.

## Scope

All approved decisions across the project lifecycle.

## Decision Record Format (MANDATORY)

Each decision MUST include:

- **Decision ID**
- **Plan Section**
- **Decision Type** (architecture / security / schema / policy / feature)
- **Date Approved**
- **Decision**
- **Affected Modules / Systems**
- **Status** (active / implemented / superseded)
- **Superseded By**

If any field is missing → the decision is **INVALID**.

### DEC-020: OAuth Providers — Google + Apple Only (v1)
- **Plan Section:** PLAN-AUTH-001
- **Decision Type:** architecture
- **Date Approved:** 2026-04-09
- **Decision:** V1 OAuth providers limited to Google and Apple only. No additional social providers (GitHub, Facebook, Discord, etc.) in v1. Email/Password is the primary method; Google and Apple are supplementary. Lovable Cloud supports these natively. Resolves OQ-001.
- **Affected Modules / Systems:** auth, user-panel
- **Status:** superseded
- **Superseded By:** DEC-025

### DEC-021: Deferred Work Register Protocol
- **Plan Section:** PLAN-GOV-001
- **Decision Type:** policy
- **Date Approved:** 2026-04-10
- **Decision:** Approved work that cannot be completed in its original phase MUST be registered in `deferred-work-register.md` with full schema (source section, blocking dependencies, future phase assignment, required tests for closure). Deferred gate items carried to a future phase become prerequisite sub-gates of the receiving phase and must be completed before dependent implementation begins. All deferred items must be reviewed at every phase boundary. Items may only be cancelled via change control with a decision record.

### DEC-022: Cross-Tenant Gate Item — N/A for v1
- **Plan Section:** PLAN-RBAC-001
- **Decision Type:** policy
- **Date Approved:** 2026-04-10
- **Decision:** Phase 2 gate item 11 ("Cross-tenant isolation verified") is marked N/A for v1. The system is single-tenant by architecture — there are no tenant boundaries, no tenant_id columns, and no multi-tenant RLS policies. The gate item is architecturally inapplicable. If multi-tenancy is introduced in a future version, this gate must be re-activated with tenant-scoped RLS verification.

### DEC-023: Stage 3A Shared API Infrastructure

### DEC-024: Export-Time Metadata Sanitization
- **Plan Section:** PLAN-AUDIT-001
- **Decision Type:** security
- **Date Approved:** 2026-04-10
- **Decision:** Audit log export applies allowlist-based metadata sanitization at export time as defense-in-depth. Only explicitly approved metadata keys are included in exported data. This supplements (does not replace) write-time sanitization in `logAuditEvent()`.

### DEC-026: Audit Export Format — CSV v1
- **Plan Section:** PLAN-AUDIT-001
- **Decision Type:** feature
- **Date Approved:** 2026-04-10
- **Decision:** Audit log export uses CSV format in v1 (not JSON). CSV was chosen for compliance-team accessibility — CSV is universally readable by compliance/legal teams and spreadsheet tools. JSON export may be added as a secondary format in future if API consumers require it.

### DEC-027: Static Permission Model — Permissions Are System-Defined
- **Plan Section:** PLAN-RBAC-001
- **Decision Type:** architecture
- **Date Approved:** 2026-04-11
- **Decision:** Permissions are statically defined by developers at build time, registered in `permission-index.md` (the SSOT), and seeded into the database at deploy time. Admins cannot create, delete, or modify permissions at runtime — they can only assign/revoke existing permissions to/from roles. This matches the model used by AWS IAM, GitHub, Stripe, and Kubernetes. Permission CRUD UI is explicitly out of scope and is NOT a gap. The `rbac.md` line "Every resource must define permissions at creation" refers to development-time module creation, not runtime admin actions. This is confirmed by line 55: "No permission may exist at runtime unless it is registered in the Permission Index with an immutable key."

### DEC-028: Configurable Per-Panel MFA Enforcement Policy + Per-User MFA Self-Preference
- **Plan Section:** PLAN-AUTH-MFA-POLICY-001
- **Decision Type:** architecture / security
- **Date Approved:** 2026-05-13
- **Decision:** Replace hard-coded admin MFA enforcement with two independent, opt-in layers governed by data, not code. **Layer 1 (panel policy, superadmin-controlled):** `system_config.mfa_enforcement_policy` holds `{ panels: { admin: 'required' \| 'optional' } }`, extensible to future panels (`trading`, `finance`, …) without schema change. When a panel is `required` and the user has access but no MFA factor, the panel layout redirects to `/mfa-enroll`. Affects only that panel — never the user's own dashboard. **Layer 2 (self-preference, user-controlled):** `profiles.require_mfa_for_self` boolean lets each user opt themselves into mandatory MFA across their authenticated routes. Superadmin cannot toggle this. **Sacrosanct:** once enrolled, the Supabase `aal1→aal2` challenge is unaffected by either layer — only an explicit user unenroll removes TOTP. Three dedicated edge functions (`get-mfa-policy`, `update-mfa-policy`, `update-mfa-self-pref`) implement this — chosen over extending `get/update-system-config` to keep MFA-policy logic separated from onboarding-mode logic. Strict `required | optional` enum (no `disabled` value). Production deployment SOP forces `panels.admin = 'required'` (preproduction-checklist.md). Every change audited via `system.mfa_policy_changed` and `user.mfa_self_pref_changed`.

### DEC-029: Sensitive-Action Re-Authentication ("Sudo Mode")
- **Plan Section:** PLAN-AUTH-SUDO-001
- **Decision Type:** security / architecture
- **Date Approved:** 2026-05-13
- **Decision:** Introduce a session-scoped "sudo mode" that requires a fresh credential challenge (current password OR current TOTP code via the existing `ReauthDialog`) before any account-takeover-relevant mutation: (a) entering MFA enrollment (`/mfa-enroll`), (b) toggling `profiles.require_mfa_for_self` ON or OFF, (c) unenrolling a TOTP factor, (d) changing password, (e) generating or regenerating recovery codes. A successful reauth sets a `sudo_until` timestamp in `sessionStorage` valid for `auth.sudo_window_seconds` (default 300 s, superadmin-tunable via `system_config`). Protected actions check `sudo_until > now()` and re-prompt otherwise. The sudo grant and every protected action are audited via the new edge function `log-sudo-event` writing to `audit_logs` with actions `auth.sudo_granted` and `auth.sensitive_action_performed`. Sudo MUST be cleared on `signOut`, on successful password change, and is naturally cleared on tab close (sessionStorage lifecycle). Sudo is orthogonal to AAL — fresh-credential proof, not MFA-elevated session. Closes the unlocked-public-computer attack vector (attacker enrolling their own TOTP + flipping `require_mfa_for_self` → permanent lockout of legitimate user). No new permissions, no new roles, no new tables — only a new edge function, a new system_config key, and two new audit event names.

## Decision Integrity Rules

- Every approved plan section MUST have a corresponding `DEC-NNN` entry
- Decisions are **NEVER** deleted — only superseded
- Superseded decisions MUST reference the original decision ID
- New decisions that replace existing ones MUST include a `superseded-by` link

## Enforcement Rule (CRITICAL)

- AI MUST read this document before any plan revision or execution
- If a proposed change conflicts with an active decision → the change is **INVALID** unless supersession is explicitly defined
- No decision may be ignored, bypassed, or implicitly overridden

## Traceability Requirement

All superseded decisions MUST maintain a traceable chain:
- Original decision → superseded-by → new decision
- Chains must remain intact for full historical reasoning

## Dependencies

- [Constitution](../00-governance/constitution.md) — Rule 8 (approved plan preservation)
- [Master Plan](master-plan.md)

## Used By / Affects

- AI Operating Model (mandatory reading step)
- All plan revisions
- All execution decisions

## Risks If Changed

HIGH — corruption of this document breaks memory, decision integrity, and system consistency.
