# System State

> **Owner:** Project Lead | **Last Reviewed:** 2026-04-12

## Purpose

Single source of truth for the current state of the project.

This file controls:
- What actions are allowed
- What phase the system is in
- Which plan baseline is active

It MUST be read before every task.

## Scope

Tracks:
- Phase
- Code generation status
- Module implementation status
- Active work
- Plan versioning

## Enforcement Rule (CRITICAL)

- This file MUST be read before any task begins
- If this file is outdated or inconsistent → execution is **INVALID**
- If required updates are missing → tasks must **STOP** until corrected
- This file overrides assumptions — only the state defined here is valid

## RBAC Governance Hardening (2026-04-13)

Comprehensive hardening pass on RBAC enforcement across server and UI layers. Key changes:

### Server-Side Enforcement
- **Superadmin-only permissions (9 keys)**: `permissions.assign`, `permissions.revoke`, `roles.create`, `roles.edit`, `roles.delete`, `jobs.emergency`, `admin.config`, `monitoring.configure`, `audit.export` — permanently restricted to `superadmin` role at edge function level. Any attempt to assign these to a non-superadmin role returns `403 SUPERADMIN_ONLY_PERMISSION`.
- **Edge functions hardened**: `assign-permission-to-role` and `revoke-permission-from-role` both validate against `SUPERADMIN_ONLY_PERMISSIONS` set before executing.

### UI Enforcement
- **Permission inheritance visibility**: Base user-role permissions (5 keys: `users.view_self`, `users.edit_self`, `profile.self_manage`, `mfa.self_manage`, `session.self_manage`) display as checked/disabled with "inherited from user role" badge on all non-user roles.
- **Superadmin-only badge**: 9 restricted permissions show as disabled with "superadmin only" badge on all non-superadmin roles.
- **Effective permission count**: Role list and detail pages show union of direct + inherited permissions.
- **8 button-level gaps closed**: Create Role, Edit Role, Delete Role, Assign Role, Revoke Role, Deactivate User, Reactivate User, Revoke Sessions — all permission-gated with `checkPermission()`.
- **Reauth dialog fix**: Resolved TanStack Query v5 `onError` ordering conflict — moved reauth detection to global mutation `onError` handler, moved `refetch()` to `onSettled`.

### Regression Tests
- Updated `rw008-permission-deps-drift.test.ts` to align with `_shared/permission-deps.ts` import architecture.

## Execution Control Rules

- If `code_generation: blocked` → **NO** code may be generated
- If `phase: documentation-only` → **ONLY** documentation tasks allowed
- If `approved_plan_baseline: none` → **NO** implementation allowed
- Execution MUST use the approved plan baseline defined here

## Update Rule

This file MUST be updated when any of the following occur:
- Architecture changes
- Module status changes (started, in progress, completed)
- Phase changes (documentation → development)
- Plan version changes (new version approved)
- Code generation status changes

**Failure to update this file = INVALID system state**

## Consistency Requirement

This file MUST remain consistent with:
- `master-plan.md`
- `approved-decisions.md`
- `action-tracker.md`
- Module documentation status

If inconsistency is detected → execution must **STOP** and be corrected.

## AI Behavior Constraint

- AI must **NOT** modify this file unless triggered by the defined update rules
- AI must **NOT** assume state — only this file defines the current system state
- If unclear → **STOP** and request clarification

## Dependencies

- [Constitution](constitution.md)
- [Master Plan](../08-planning/master-plan.md)

## Used By / Affects

All tasks, planning, and execution decisions.

## Risks If Changed

HIGH — incorrect state causes incorrect execution, plan drift, and system inconsistency.
